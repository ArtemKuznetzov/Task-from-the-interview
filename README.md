User is trying to find courses. There are four types:
1. Courses with fixed prices. For example from 50 to 250. 
2. Courses with "free" price. If user types 0 in "From" input, that means, that he want to find free courses. For example from 0 to 100.
3. Courses with first fixed price. That means that the user is only interested in the initial price. The first input should be empty. For example from 200 and "To" input is empty.
4. Courses with second fixed price. That means that the user is only interested in the final price. The second input should be empty.For example "From" input is empty and to 400
